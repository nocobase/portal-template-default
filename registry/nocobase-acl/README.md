# NocoBase ACL UI

Reusable ACL composition components for the NocoBase Refine starter.

After installation, import the components from `@/extensions/nocobase-acl`.

- The Starter's `CanAccess` supports role, resource, record, and field checks.
- `AclPage` combines page-level permissions.
- `AclRegion` hides or replaces individual data regions.
- `AclField` applies NocoBase field whitelists.
- `RoleSwitcher` can be placed in any application surface. It supports
  normal roles, Anonymous when enabled, and Full permissions through the
  `__union__` role when the system role mode allows it.

Application route definitions and `AclPage` accept a `roles` constraint with
`anyOf`, `allOf`, and `noneOf`. Put route-level constraints in `access.roles`
through `defineAppRoutes`; the Starter applies the same constraint to menu
visibility and direct URL access. Role constraints use the roles in the current
effective ACL context. In union mode this is the set of roles participating in
the union; in single-role mode it is only the selected role. Regions, fields,
and actions continue to use resource permissions.

Nested routes inherit their parents' route access. The generated navigation
item evaluates every constraint in that route chain, matching the nested route
guards used for direct URL access.

Use the Starter's `useGetRoles()` hook when application UI needs the same
effective role names. Its result follows the familiar Refine query shape with
`data`, `isLoading`, `isPending`, `isError`, and `error`. `data` is the active
ACL role set, not every role assigned to the signed-in user.

```tsx
import { useGetRoles } from "@/lib/nocobase/acl";

function CurrentAccessContext() {
  const { data: roles, isLoading } = useGetRoles();

  if (isLoading) return null;
  return <span>Effective roles: {roles?.join(", ")}</span>;
}
```

```tsx
import { defineAppRoutes } from "@/app/route-runtime";

export const appRoutes = defineAppRoutes([
  {
    name: "administration",
    path: "/administration",
    element: <AdministrationPage />,
    resource: {
      meta: {
        label: "Administration",
      },
    },
    access: {
      roles: { anyOf: ["admin"] },
    },
  },
]);

function AuditLogsRoute() {
  return (
    <AclPage roles={{ anyOf: ["admin", "auditor"] }}>
      <AclRegion resource="auditLogs" action="list">
        <AuditLogTable />
      </AclRegion>
    </AclPage>
  );
}
```

The route runtime marks generated non-collection resources as authenticated.
Use the `collection`, `snippet`, and `route` ACL metadata variants when a
resource should also participate in NocoBase permission checks.

The underlying `accessControlProvider`, `roles:check` cache, record permissions,
and Refine integration are provided by the compatible Starter.

The Demo uses the real `CanAccess`, `AclPage`, `AclRegion`, and `AclField`
components. A local `AclPreviewProvider` supplies a static in-memory ACL store
so both allowed and restricted outcomes remain visible without changing the
current user's real roles. It does not replace Refine's access-control context.
Applications use the Starter's root `AclStoreProvider` and production `aclStore`.

Global ACL permissions remain fixed for one page session. Switching roles saves
the selected role and reloads the page so navigation, routes, data access, and
Refine permission queries all start from the same `roles:check` result.
